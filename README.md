<span id="installation"></span>
## Installation

Rainbomizer requires an **ASI-Loader** to function. It works with **all** versions of the game, but only the latest (Steam), 1.0.4.0, 1.1.2.0, 1.0.7.0, and 1.0.8.0 versions have been tested.

1. Install **one** of the listed ASI Loaders: 
    - [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/v4.52/Ultimate-ASI-Loader.zip) by [ThirteenAG](https://github.com/ThirteenAG) is a popular option since it supports CrashDumps, which will be necessary if you want to report a crash.
    - [xliveless](https://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-xliveless) (1.0.8.0 and below only) - required for versions before Complete Edition. xliveless removes requirement for GFWL and also includes an ASI-Loader

2. Download Rainbomizer from [Releases](https://github.com/Parik27/IV.EFLC.Rainbomizer/releases) and **extract the archive** to the root directory of GTA IV. 
  
   The directory structure should look something like this:
    ```
      GTAIV.exe
        IV.Rainbomizer.asi
        rainbomizer/
            config.toml
            data/
                ...
        dinput8.dll (or xlive.dll for 1.0.8.0 and below)
    ```
    
## Configuration

If you wish to change any of the mod's functionalities, for example to disable a specific randomizer, a configuration file (`config.toml`) has been provided with the mod. The config file is located in the `rainbomizer` folder in the game's root directory.

The default configuration file is in the main repository, `config.toml`, and is automatically created by the mod if it doesn't exist in the rainbomizer folder.

The configuration file is in the TOML format. It is similar in structure to INI's, but with a defined and better structure.

To configure a specific randomizer, search for its name in the configuration file. You can set the "Enabled" key to 'true' or 'false' to enable or disable it respectively.

More information about how to configure specific randomizers is provided in the default config file.
